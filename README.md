# Staten Island Transit

New York City is known for its vast transportation system. Many residents utilize public transportation for everyday travel. However, there are times when every New Yorker faces the inconvenience of late transportation, whether it be buses or trains. Therefore, our group intends to focus on improving a bus route (the S57) in Staten Island that frequently incoveniences many Staten Island residents, either by not arriving on-time or by not arriving at all for consecutive scheduled times. 

### Issues with the S57
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://github.com/pmendoza41/Staten-Island-Transit/blob/master/S57%20weekday%20service.PNG?raw=true" /></div>

The main issue with the S57 bus is that it fails to follow its set schedule. According to the [weekday time schedule](http://web.mta.info/nyct/bus/schedule/staten/s057cur.pdf) of the S57, the bus is supposed to arrive every 10-20 minutes in the morning, and then every 30 minutes in the afternoon and evening. Nevertheless, after recording the times the S57 bus arrived at Bradley Av/Victory Blvd for a random day during the week and for a random day during the weekend (Thursday and Saturday), and comparing those times to the scheduled times, the bus failed to adhere to the schedule times for the weekday and weekend service. From the tables below, some S57 buses even failed to show up at all. However, there were a few cases where the bus came a couple of minutes early.

Also, above is a map of the S57 bus route from Port Richmond to Oakwood Heights and vice versa. When zoomed in on certain parts of the bus route, there are adjacent bus stops that are in close proximity to each other. Additionally, there are certain loops that host multiple S57 bus stops. This most likely contributes to the increased longevity of the bus ride, thus increasing occurrences of late arrivals. 

### Inspiration: Jarrett Walker, Public Transit Consultant

The main issue with the transit lines can be summarized quite well by transit designer Jarrett Walker, known for his work on improving transit lines in Barcelona, Spain, and Houston, Texas. In the article [“Explainer: The Transit Ridership Recipe,”](http://humantransit.org/2015/07/mega-explainer-the-ridership-recipe.html)he describes the main problem he encounters with transit lines: ridership versus coverage. Ridership is a measure for transit determined by demand, where, for example, a route will be created in an area that is highly frequented, like downtown Manhattan, to benefit the people. Coverage, a term coined by Jarrett Walker, spreads a route over a longer area to benefit people no matter where they live.  Walker has determined that when creating a route, an official tends to create a route that has more coverage to appease all his constituents. Of course, this leads to longer routes, which sacrifices reliability, and causes the route to be longer and buses less frequent. Frequency is a very important aspect of a bus route because it reduces wait time, and therefore, travel time. Moreover, it allows for easier connections, which helps create a more efficient transit network. Additionally, it creates a stable backbone for reliability, so that if a vehicle breaks down, for example, another is sure to come soon after.

In terms of [ridership](http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_bus_annual.htm), the number of riders of the S57 greatly declined from 2014 to 2015. The unreliability of the bus possibly contributed to this decrease. 

Walker also argues that to create a route, specifically a bus route, there are four main aspects to consider- density, walkability, linearity, and proximity. Density refers to how high the population is within the area-where a bus becomes more useful as more people are within the range of its services. Similarly, walkability is judged by how well passengers can walk between stops, assuming a maximum walk distance of ¼ of a mile between each station. Linearity discusses how straight the route itself is, judging the efficiency of a straighter route against the small loops or detours within certain establishments that might benefit certain passengers. Proximity judges distance between locations on the bus route, acknowledging that a longer distance between certain locations is more expensive to run and tends to lead to less frequent buses.

We plan to incorporate these guidelines to improve the s57 bus route in Staten Island, taking into account demand, distance between key locations on the route, and how many people actually use the route.

### Proposed Changes to S57 Route 

Based on Jarrett Walker’s philosophy on creating efficient bus routes, and our own observations of the S57 bus route, we created a few changes that might decrease the time each bus takes to get to its destination, and increase the frequency with which buses show up at stops. The changes include eliminating some stops and changing the locations of others, along with changing the bus timetable to make the buses appear more frequently to reduce wait time.

In the picture above of the Staten Island Districts, the red areas represent industrial districts, while the orange and yellow districts represent living areas. Darker areas mean a slightly higher population according to the zoning. Staten Island is a relatively low population area, which is why there is not much contrast between the residential district colors. This is why we did not base changing the bus route on population density.

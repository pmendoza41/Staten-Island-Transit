# Staten Island Transit: Improving the S57 
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://github.com/pmendoza41/Staten-Island-Transit/blob/master/S57.jpg?raw=true" /></div>

New York City is known for its vast transportation system, therefore, many of its residents utilize public transportation for ther everyday travel. However, there are times when every New Yorker faces the inconvenience of late transportation, whether it be late buses or trains. As a result, our group intends to focus on improving a bus route in Staten Island, the S57 bus line, that frequently incoveniences many Staten Island residents, either by not arriving on-time or by not arriving at all for consecutive scheduled times. 

### The S57 bus route 
<script src="https://embed.github.com/view/geojson/pmendoza41/Staten-Island-Transit/master/map%20(4).geojson"></script>
In order to create potential designs for improvements of the S57 bus route, our group decided to make geojson map of the S57 bus line from New Dorp to Port Richmond and back. This allowed us to examine the layout of the route and the proximity between adjacent bus stops, thus providing us with a basis for the creation of potential improvements. Based on this map, there are certain loops that host multiple S57 bus stops. This most likely contributes to the increased longevity of the bus ride, thus increasing occurrences of late arrivals. 

### Issues with the S57 
The main issue with the S57 bus is that it fails to follow its set schedule. According to the [weekday time schedule](http://web.mta.info/nyct/bus/schedule/staten/s057cur.pdf) of the S57, the bus is supposed to arrive every 10-20 minutes in the morning, and then every 30 minutes in the afternoon and evening. Nevertheless, after recording the times the S57 bus arrived at Bradley Av/Victory Blvd for a random day during the week and for a random day during the weekend (Thursday and Saturday), and comparing those times to the scheduled times, there were times where the bus failed to adhere to the schedule times for the weekday and weekend service. From the tables below, some S57 buses even failed to show up at all. However, there were a few cases where the bus came a couple of minutes early.

In terms of [ridership](http://web.mta.info/nyct/facts/ridership/ridership_bus_annual.htm), the number of riders of the S57 greatly declined by 5.6% from 2014 to 2015. This decline equates to approximately 30,000 riders. The unreliability of the bus possibly contributed to this decrease. 

### Inspiration: Jarrett Walker, Public Transit Consultant

The main issue with the transit lines can be summarized quite well by transit designer Jarrett Walker, known for his work on improving transit lines in Barcelona, Spain, and Houston, Texas. In the article [“Explainer: The Transit Ridership Recipe,”](http://humantransit.org/2015/07/mega-explainer-the-ridership-recipe.html)he describes the main problem he encounters with transit lines: ridership versus coverage. Ridership is a measure for transit determined by demand, where, for example, a route will be created in an area that is highly frequented, like downtown Manhattan, to benefit the people. Coverage, a term coined by Jarrett Walker, spreads a route over a longer area to benefit people no matter where they live.  Walker has determined that when creating a route, an official tends to create a route that has more coverage to appease all his constituents. Of course, this leads to longer routes, which sacrifices reliability, and causes the route to be longer and buses less frequent. Frequency is a very important aspect of a bus route because it reduces wait time, and therefore, travel time. Moreover, it allows for easier connections, which helps create a more efficient transit network. Additionally, it creates a stable backbone for reliability, so that if a vehicle breaks down, for example, another is sure to come soon after.

Walker also argues that to create a route, specifically a bus route, there are four main aspects to consider- density, walkability, linearity, and proximity. Density refers to how high the population is within the area-where a bus becomes more useful as more people are within the range of its services. Similarly, walkability is judged by how well passengers can walk between stops, assuming a maximum walk distance of ¼ of a mile between each station. Linearity discusses how straight the route itself is, judging the efficiency of a straighter route against the small loops or detours within certain establishments that might benefit certain passengers. Proximity judges distance between locations on the bus route, acknowledging that a longer distance between certain locations is more expensive to run and tends to lead to less frequent buses.

We plan to incorporate these guidelines to improve the s57 bus route in Staten Island, taking into account demand, distance between key locations on the route, and how many people actually use the route.

### Proposed Changes to S57 Route 

Based on Jarrett Walker’s philosophy on creating efficient bus routes, and our own observations of the S57 bus route, we created a few changes that might decrease the time each bus takes to get to its destination, and increase the frequency with which buses show up at stops. The changes include eliminating some stops and changing the locations of others, along with changing the bus timetable to make the buses appear more frequently to reduce wait time.

In the picture above of the Staten Island Districts, the red areas represent industrial districts, while the orange and yellow districts represent living areas. Darker areas mean a slightly higher population according to the zoning. Staten Island is a relatively low population borough, which is why there is not much contrast between the residential district colors. This is why we did not base changing the bus route on population density.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://github.com/pmendoza41/Staten-Island-Transit/blob/master/voronoi.png?raw=true" /></div>

Based on our vornoi map, most of the bus stops are close together and evenly spaced. Therefore, it was also not necessary to take out or move many stops.

**Seaview Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home**

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://github.com/pmendoza41/Staten-Island-Transit/blob/master/Seaview.png?raw=true" /></div>

This loop goes to the Seaview Hospital Rehabilitation Center and Home. Instead of spending time making a loop, there could be a shuttle bus that goes to the S57 bus stops and picks passengers who want to enter the Seaview loop. The inspiration from this came from our own college, CSI, which has a shuttle bus that makes a full circle of the college every twenty minutes.

**New Dorp Loop**

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="https://github.com/pmendoza41/Staten-Island-Transit/blob/master/New%20Dorp.png?raw=true" /></div>

This loop goes around Richmond Road, New Dorp Lane, N Railroad Avenue, and Rose Avenue. Although completely eliminating the loop would play into Walker’s idea of linearity, there are buses around the loop that people could transfer to.Therefore, a compromise would be keeping the stop at Richmond Rd and 1st Street, and the one at New Dorp Lane and N Railroad Ave. 

**Changing the Bus Frequency**
We determined that the main way to ensure that buses arrive on time to their stops is to increase the frequency of buses traversing the route. Increasing the frequency of buses arriving will help improve reliability and cause an increase in ridership, which could raise revenue for the MTA.

**Final Statement**
We addressed the linearity of the route by cutting out the Seaview loop and decreasing the amount of stops on the New Dorp loop, and proposed increasing the frequency of buses on the route to have it follow the schedule.
